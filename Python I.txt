Python I

Interactive mode vs. Script mode

Interactive mode:
- open terminal
- python3 (current version), enter
- help() leads to the help menu; help(print) shows you information about the object “print”
→ the terminal runs now the “Python interpreter”, if code is entered it the interpreter replies immediately
→ advantage: easy testing of small code peaces (type & execute), quick help

Script mode:
- open text editor
- enter code
- save text file (end with .py)
- open terminal
- enter file path (where your file is saved)
- start python before loading your file (~ python Uebung.py), enter
→ the interpreter reads your file & shows the output
→ advantage: if coding a program the code should always be saved, so you can execute and modify it later

Programming

- error-prone
- error = bug, removing an error = debugging

	syntax error:
	- syntax = structure of a program
	- SyntaxError: invalid syntax followed by the line where the interpreter was forced to quit 	execution

	runtime error:
	- rare
	- do not appear before program was started

	semantic errors:
	- program runs (no error message will be generated), but shows wrong output
	- although no coding error, wrong approach 

- formal languages (designed by people for specific applications), literal, can be understood entirely by analysis of the code
- learn to interpret the structure of a program
- small errors in spelling and punctuation (insignificant in natural languages) make the difference




The first program

- program = sequence of instructions
- gets input (from keyboard, file etc.)
- gives output (displays (processed) data)
- maths (based on basic mathematical operations)
- conditional execution (Fallunterscheidung) (check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code)
- repetition (Schleife) (repeated action (with variations))


print(“xyxyxy”): output xyxyxy
with “xyxyxy” being a string (of letters) 
strings (str) are enclosed in quotation marks and represent sequences of characters
integer (int) represents whole numbers
floating-point represents numbers with fractional parts
